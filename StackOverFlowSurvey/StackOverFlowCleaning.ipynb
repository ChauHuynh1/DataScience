In order to have an accurate result, data prepration step must be done precisely. First of all, data from the csv file which is named \"survey_results_public.csv\" is loaded by \"read_csv\" in pandas function. After that, all the data types must be checked to ensure no column has incorrect data types assigned. Having been checked the data types, the loaded data is cleaned by 6 steps which are typos, extra-whitespaces, upper/lower-case, sanity checks, missing values, and categorical data </p>\n",

    "Stack Overflow is the largest, most trusted online community for developers to learn, share their knowledge, and build their careers. More than 50 million professional and aspiring programmers visit Stack Overflow each month to help solve coding problems, develop new skills, and find job opportunities. Stack Overflow partners with businesses to help them understand, hire, engage, and enable the world's developers. Our products and services focus on developer marketing, technical recruiting, market research, and enterprise knowledge sharing. Learn more about our business solutions here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each year, Stack Overflow ask the developer community about everything from their favorite technologies to their job preferences. This year marks the eighth year they‚Äôve published their Annual Developer Survey results‚Äîwith the largest number of respondents yet. Over 100,000 developers took the 30-minute survey in January 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "This year, Stack Overflow covered a few new topics ranging from artificial intelligence to ethics in coding. They also found that underrepresented groups in tech responded to our survey at even lower rates than they would expect from their participation in the workforce. We are going to dive into the results ourselves and see what we can learn about salaries or machine learning or diversity in tech?"

Nevertheless, the computer cannot understand that mistake. Secondly, the extra-whitespaces can be record as NaN values in pandas, which results in unexpected result.
